            <h3>India reports 40,134 new Covid-19 cases, 422 deaths in last 24 hours</h3>
            <p> India reported 40,134 new Covid-19 cases and 422 deaths on Monday, as per data from the Union Health Ministry.

The daily count of cases has been over 40,000 for six consecutive days now. Kerala has been reporting over 20,000 cases during this period.

The total number of coronavirus cases has reached 3,16,95,958 while the overall death toll stands at 4,24,773. There are 4,13,718 active cases in the country at present. In Kerala, active cases have increased to 1.67 lakh.

            <h3>India reports most new COVID cases in three weeks</h3>
            <p>India has reported 44,230 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, the highest in three weeks, the latest evidence of a worrying trend of rising cases that has forced one state to lock down amid fears of another wave of infections.

India was battered by the Delta variant of the virus in April and May but the rate of spread of infections later eased off. It has again been rising, with higher numbers in seven of the past eight days. Health experts have called for faster vaccinations to stave off another big surge.

The government estimates that 67.6 percent of the 1.35 billion population already have antibodies against the coronavirus, with nearly 38 percent of the adult population of about 944 million having received at least one vaccine dose.

The disease’s estimated reproduction rate, or R-value, has also inched up in the past week,

The R-value hit 1 on July 24 – meaning on average, every 10 people infected will infect 10 others – for the first time since May when daily infections were near a peak of 400,000.

The southern state of Kerala announced a new lockdown on Thursday, while movement restrictions are in place in some northeastern states reporting a rise in infection rates.

Other places, including the capital New Delhi, have recently reopened most economic activities.</p>

            <h3>Why the delta variant is spreading COVID-19 so quickly — and what that means for Canada</h3>
            <p>It's the word on everyone's mind right now when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic: Delta.

The highly contagious variant, which was first discovered in India in late 2020, has spread around the world and now accounts for the majority of cases in Canada and various other countries.

The recent spread in the United States has led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend that Americans wear masks in areas with substantial transmission "regardless of vaccination status."

So, why is this particular variant spreading so rapidly? And what's the mechanism at play behind its apparent success at infecting human hosts?

    Delta variant as contagious as chickenpox, CDC says

The answers are complicated, and there are still unknowns around how, exactly, the delta variant was able to take hold at such a brisk pace, throwing a wrench in global efforts to wind down the pandemic.

But we are getting closer to understanding how it works — and why vaccines, thankfully, still hold up.</p>
